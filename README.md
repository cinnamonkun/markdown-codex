# VSCode Markdown Viewer

This repository extracts VS Code's builtâ€‘in Markdown extensions. `index.html` uses
these files to render Markdown in the same way as VS Code's preview.

Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser. The page works without a web
server. Use the file picker at the top to choose any Markdown document from your
computer. It will be rendered using the same engine and CSS that VS Code uses
for its preview.
